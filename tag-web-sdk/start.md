The Web SDK lets you display PowaTag tags on your website.

# Requirements

In order to implement this plugin you must be able to add a JavaScript file, a CSS file and an HTML snippet to the client's site. Additionally if you are using PassTrough you'll need the ability to inject into the HTML snippet the SKU of the desired product and language if needed.
